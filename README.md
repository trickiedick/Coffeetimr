Coffeetimr
==========

A tiny Windows app to help time sessions for use with a PC in a net cafe.   

Tested in Windows XP/Vista/7

Can be used with sets of timed key code numbers (generated by the code generator app) or simply with a fixed password (set in the .ini file)so that users are constrained to a given session length.
