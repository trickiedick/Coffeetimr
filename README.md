Coffeetimr
==========

A tiny Windows app to help time sessions for use with a PC in a net cafe.   

Tested in Windows XP/Vista/7

Can be used with sets of timed key code numbers (generated by the code generator app) or simply with a fixed password (set in the .ini file)so that users are constrained to a given session length.

It works by launching the browser application on demand and by killing any apps that it doesn't want running, so if not logged in it kills any browser apps.  It is quick and dirty - but it works.

For public use I would also set the DNS of user machines to use Open DNS as a form of safe surfing protection.
